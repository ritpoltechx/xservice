# Agent Instructions

You're working inside the **WAT framework** (Workflows, Agents, Tools). This architecture separates concerns so that probabilistic AI handles reasoning while deterministic code handles execution. That separation is what makes this system reliable.

## The WAT Architecture

**Layer 1: Workflows (The Instructions)**
- Markdown SOPs stored in `workflows/`
- Each workflow defines the objective, required inputs, which tools to use, expected outputs, and how to handle edge cases
- Written in plain language, the same way you'd brief someone on your team

**Layer 2: Agents (The Decision-Maker)**
- This is your role. You're responsible for intelligent coordination.
- Read the relevant workflow, run tools in the correct sequence, handle failures gracefully, and ask clarifying questions when needed
- You connect intent to execution without trying to do everything yourself
- Example: If you need to fetch market data, don't attempt it directly. Read the relevant workflow in `workflows/`, figure out the required inputs, then execute the appropriate script in `tools/`

**Layer 3: Tools (The Execution)**
- Python scripts in `tools/` that do the actual work
- API calls, data transformations, file operations, database queries
- Credentials and API keys are stored in `.env`
- These scripts are consistent, testable, and fast

**Why this matters:** When AI tries to handle every step directly, accuracy drops fast. If each step is 90% accurate, you're down to 59% success after just five steps. By offloading execution to deterministic scripts, you stay focused on orchestration and decision-making where you excel.

## How to Operate

**1. Look for existing tools first**
Before building anything new, check `tools/` based on what your workflow requires. Only create new scripts when nothing exists for that task.

**2. Learn and adapt when things fail**
When you hit an error:
- Read the full error message and trace
- Fix the script and retest (if it uses paid API calls or credits, check with me before running again)
- Document what you learned in the workflow (rate limits, timing quirks, unexpected behavior)
- Example: You get rate-limited on an exchange API, so you dig into the docs, discover a batch endpoint, refactor the tool to use it, verify it works, then update the workflow so this never happens again

**3. Keep workflows current**
Workflows should evolve as you learn. When you find better methods, discover constraints, or encounter recurring issues, update the workflow. That said, don't create or overwrite workflows without asking unless I explicitly tell you to. These are your instructions and need to be preserved and refined, not tossed after one use.

## The Self-Improvement Loop

Every failure is a chance to make the system stronger:
1. Identify what broke
2. Fix the tool
3. Verify the fix works
4. Update the workflow with the new approach
5. Move on with a more robust system

## File Structure

**What goes where:**
- **Deliverables**: Final outputs go to cloud services (Google Sheets, Slides, etc.) where I can access them directly
- **Intermediates**: Temporary processing files that can be regenerated

**Directory layout:**
```
.tmp/           # Temporary files (market data snapshots, intermediate exports). Regenerated as needed.
tools/          # Python scripts for deterministic execution
workflows/      # Markdown SOPs defining what to do and how
.env            # API keys and environment variables (NEVER store secrets anywhere else)
```

**Core principle:** Local files are just for processing. Anything I need to see or use lives in cloud services. Everything in `.tmp/` is disposable.

## Bottom Line

You sit between what I want (workflows) and what actually gets done (tools). Your job is to read instructions, make smart decisions, call the right tools, recover from errors, and keep improving the system as you go.

Stay pragmatic. Stay reliable. Keep learning.

## Design System — "Nova Style"

Optimized for **high-density data applications**. Underwriters need to scan vast amounts of information quickly.

- **Tablet-First**: The primary usage is on **tablets**. Avoid hover-only interactions (e.g., showing icons only on hover). All interactive affordances (sort icons, action buttons, tooltips) must be **always visible** since touch devices have no hover state.
- **Compact Density**: Reduced padding/margins to fit more data without clutter.
- **Clear Boundaries**: Borders and subtle background differences separate data sections.
- **Function over Form**: Every pixel conveys information or actionable status.

Full design rules: `.agent/workflows/design-rules.md` — run `/design-rules` to review.

## Color Palette

### Brand Colors
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-chaiyo-blue` | `#10069F` | Primary buttons, active states, focus rings |
| `--color-chaiyo-gold` | `#FFD100` | Accent highlights, "recommended" tags |

### Status Colors
| Status | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Approved / Success | `#10B981` (Emerald) | Approved apps, successful saves |
| Pending / Warning | `#F59E0B` (Amber) | Apps in review, missing info |
| Rejected / Error | `#EF4444` (Red) | Rejected apps, critical errors |

### Structural Colors
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Background | `#F9FAFB` | Page canvas (light gray) |
| Surface/Card | `#FFFFFF` | Content containers |
| Text Primary | `#111827` | Main readable text |
| Text Muted | `#6B7280` | Labels, help text, secondary info |
| `--color-border-color` | `#E5E7EB` | Default borders |
| `--color-border-subtle` | `#F3F4F6` | Card borders, separators |
| `--color-border-strong` | `#D1D5DB` | High-contrast boundaries |

### Border Rules
- `border-gray-200` — default for inputs.
- `border-border-subtle` — outer card borders, inner separators.
- `border-border-strong` — table containers (`border border-border-strong rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-white`).
- **Never** use bare `border` without an explicit color class (Tailwind v4 defaults to `currentColor`).

## Typography

**Font**: IBM Plex Sans Thai → `ui-sans-serif` fallback.

| Level | Size | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Heading 1 | 24–30px | Page titles |
| Heading 2 | 20px | Section headers |
| Heading 3 | 16–18px | Card titles |
| Body | 14px | Standard text |
| Small | 12px | Labels, table metadata |

## Component Conventions

### Buttons
- **Primary (Solid Blue)**: Main action on screen (e.g., "Submit Application").
- **Secondary (Outline)**: Alternative actions (e.g., "Save Draft", "Back").
- **Destructive (Red)**: Warns of consequence (e.g., "Reject", "Delete").
- **Ghost (Transparent)**: Low-friction actions (e.g., "Edit" icon in a table row).

### Form Inputs
- Always use **shadcn/ui** components from `@/components/ui/`. Never create custom HTML elements when a shadcn component exists.
- Height: `h-12`, Background: `bg-white`, Radius: `rounded-xl`.
- Focus state: `border-chaiyo-blue` with subtle blue ring.
- Mandatory fields: red asterisk `<span className="text-red-500">*</span>` in `<Label>`.
- **Amount Inputs**: Use comma formatting (e.g., `1,000.00`) for all currency/amount fields to improve readability.

### Dialogs & Sheets
- **No top-right close (X) icon.** Close via footer buttons only.
- Overlay: `bg-black/10 backdrop-blur-sm`.
- **Tall Content**: If dialog content might be tall (like filter forms), use `<DialogContent className="max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto flex flex-col">` and give the inner body `flex-1 overflow-y-auto` while keeping the header/footer `flex-shrink-0` to ensure proper scrolling without overflowing the viewport.
- **Sheet**: Slides from right — for long forms where user references the underlying page.
- **Dialog**: Centered modal — for short, critical decisions.

### Tables
- Container: `border border-border-strong rounded-xl overflow-hidden bg-white`.
- Headers: `bg-gray-50/50`, muted text.
- Row hover: `hover:bg-gray-50/50` + `transition-colors`.
- Separators: `border-border-subtle`.
- **Row Deletion**: If a row can be deleted, use the `Trash2` icon (from `lucide-react`) in red color.

## Shadows & Depth

| Level | Class | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | `shadow-sm` | Cards |
| Level 2 | `shadow-lg` | Dropdowns, popovers, sticky headers |
| Level 3 | `shadow-xl` + overlay | Modals, sheets |

## Spacing System

4px grid, leaning compact:
- `gap-2` (8px): Between related buttons.
- `gap-4` (16px): Between form fields.
- `p-4` (16px): Standard card padding.
- `p-6` (24px): Page container padding.

## Z-Index Layering

| Level | Z-Index | Elements |
|---|---|---|
| Base (0) | — | Main content, cards, tables |
| Navigation (1) | `z-40` | Sidebar toggle |
| Modals (2) | `z-50+` | Dialogs, sheets, alert dialogs |
| Top (3) | Above z-50 | Tooltips, global notifications |

## Dates & Calendar

- **Buddhist Era (พ.ศ.) only** — never show A.D. years in the UI.
- Day ≤ 31, Month ≤ 12 — validated internally.
- All date storage is in **ISO A.D. format** (`YYYY-MM-DD`) internally; conversion is done at the component level.

### `DatePickerBE` — Standard Date Input Component

**Always use `<DatePickerBE />` for any date field** — never use a plain `<Input>` with manual date formatting.

```tsx
import { DatePickerBE } from "@/components/ui/DatePickerBE";

// value: stored as "YYYY-MM-DD" (A.D.) in formData
// Displays to user as "วว/ดด/ปปปป (พ.ศ.)"
<DatePickerBE
    value={formData.someDate ?? ""}
    onChange={(val) => handleChange("someDate", val)}
    inputClassName="h-12 rounded-xl"
/>
```

**Props:**
| Prop | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `value` | `string` | ISO A.D. date string `YYYY-MM-DD` (or `""`) |
| `onChange` | `(val: string) => void` | Fires with ISO A.D. date after user completes 8 digits |
| `placeholder` | `string` | Defaults to `"วว/ดด/ปปปป (พ.ศ.)"` |
| `inputClassName` | `string` | Class applied to the inner `<Input>` |
| `disabled` / `readOnly` | `boolean` | Disables interaction |
| `error` | `boolean` | Applies red border |

**Behavior:**
- User types 8 digits (no slashes needed); slashes are auto-inserted.
- If user types an A.D. year (< 2400), it auto-converts to B.E. (`+543`).
- `onChange` only fires when all 8 digits are complete and the date is valid.
- On blur, display resyncs to match the stored A.D. value.


## Language & Locale

- UI language is **Thai** (ภาษาไทย). All labels, buttons, and user-facing text are in Thai.
- Code (variables, comments, component names) is in **English**.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server at http://localhost:3000
